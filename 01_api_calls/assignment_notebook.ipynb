Announce Another Recall of Juicers WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Aroma Housewares Co., of San Diego, Calif., is recalling about 117,000 more juice extractors or juicers. The juicer\\'s filter and lid can break apart and project metal and plastic into the air, causing injuries to consumers. The firm previously recalled 40,000 juicers in June 1999. This recall includes redesigned juicers used as replacements for the original recall. Aroma Housewares has received two additional reports of the redesigned juicer\\'s filter and lid breaking apart, resulting in two consumers suffering minor injuries. There have been 32 reports of the original juicer breaking, and 32 reports of injuries. Seven of these injuries required stitches and one required surgery for lacerated arteries. All model ACJ-250 Aroma Juice Extractors are included in the recall. \"ACJ-250\" and \"MADE IN CHINA\" are written on the bottom of the juicer on a silver label. The juice extractor is made of white and clear plastic and has a metal filter. \"Aroma\" is printed on the front of the unit. Discount specialty and department stores sold the recalled juice extractors from March 1996 through July 2002 for about $25. Consumers should stop using the recalled juice extractors immediately, and call the company for information on receiving a refund. Even if consumers previously received a replacement juicer as part of the original recall, they should contact Aroma Housewares for a refund. Consumers should call Aroma Housewares at (800) 276-6286 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. PT Monday through Friday. Aroma reported to CPSC the recent incidents of the redesigned juicer breaking.

              "  'Description': 'August 27, 1990 Release # 90-142 WASHINGTON, DC -- Approximately 1,400 Sunbeam Mixmaster stand mixers produced in the first quarter of 1990 are being voluntarily recalled by the manufacturer, Sunbeam Appliance Company of Milwaukee, WI, because they may present a risk of severe electric shock. The recall which is being conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) involves two newly-introduced models of stand mixers, the 01930 and the 01940. Both of these mixers have chrome-plated housings. These mixers were distributed nationwide from February through April of this year. No other models are included in this recall. Consumers who purchased a Sunbeam stand mixer this year can determine is they have an affected model by looking for the model number and the date code on the nameplate located between the beater openings on the underside of the mixer housing. The model numbers affected are 01940 [Service No. 1-94BZ] and 01930 [Service No. 1-93BY]. The only mixers affected are those with date codes of: JPD, JPE, FPB, FPC, MPA, MPB, and MPC. The words \"Sunbeam Appliance Company,\" also appear on the nameplate. If you have one of these mixers you should stop using it immediately and contact Sunbeam. Motors and other electrical components, through shipping, use or handling, may shift and contact the inside of the chrome-plated mixer housing, which could create a risk of severe electric shock to the user. Even though no consumers have reported electric shocks from using these mixers, Sunbeam recognized the possible severity of any electric shock and reported this potential hazard to the CPSC. Sunbeam has a toll-free telephone number, 1-800-458-8407, to assist consumers in determining if they have a mixer that should be returned. The number is in operation from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Consumers who have affected mixers will be sent a pre-addressed, pre-stamped box in which to return the motor/housing of their mixer. Sunbeam will provide a replacement unit free of charge',\n",

        "    https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?_res_format_limit=0&res_format=API\n",
        "\n",
        "and in the future will likely easily be found at \\texttt{data.gov}. Some highlights include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- CDC WONDER API for Data Query Web Service: Includes death certificates with causes since approximately the 1990's.\n",
        "- Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS): Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains an API that provides Census data on housing problems and needs unavailable through other sources, including IPUMS.\n",
        "- Federal Election Commission API: Provides historical and up to the minute campaign finance data.\n",
        "- Toxic Release Inventory: Provided by the Environmental Protection Agency, this API documents the release and management of over 800 toxic substances, reported annually by privately owned facilities and the government.\n",
        "- Petroleum Data, Prices: Provides prices of petroleum products and crude oil at weekly, monthly, and yearly time scales.\n",
        "- Fair Market Rents Lookup tool: Fair Market Rents (FMRs) determine the value of housing vouchers for Section 8 renters. This API provides the FMR values and other measures of housing affordability.\n",
        "- Annual Economic Surveys, Business Patterns: Surveys of businesses at the zip code level, tracking economic sentiment and activity.\n",
        "- Food Access Research Atlas: Provides spatial data on food access and the availability of supermarkets within census tracts. Can be merged with census data to look at under-served populations and food deserts.\n",
        "- National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration: Provides API access to data on real time weather and climate change projections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of these API resources could either be the cornerstone of a project or a source of additional data. These data sources have a number of advantages: They're free, most of them can be accessed using the same API key, and most have similar documentation for how to write a query. This is ideal for students to iterate, experiment, and take risks, with little cost to failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to government data, many commerical apps provide API access to developers and researchers. AirBnB, Amazon, Reddit, eBay, X, and many others maintain API access to develop third-party apps. These opportunities present many advantages: The data are larger, have more variety, and there are vastly many more cases. Building a third-party app that includes analytics could easily consume an entire semester and open a variety of applications in predictive analytics, natural language processing, and generative AI (e.g. predict which reviews are fake or real for Amazon for a product group like ``women's watches', and then make recommendations for different price points). While an exciting possibility, this can also raise a lot of problems: Some API's cost money or are rate-limited depending on a subscription, and others impose significant constraints on how the data can be used. In some cases, a more useful approach might be explicit web scraping using a package like BeautifulSoup or Selenium. For example, Craigslist has no API, but can easily and productively be scraped using BeautifulSoup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Pick an API, download some data, wrangle them, and produce some EDA results, as we did in the previous steps with the saferproducts.gov API; or, if you can't get it to work, document why. If you have the time and it's low cost, push the results to a streamlit page. If you have had enough, I recommend https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/electricity, since there is a friendly query builder that you can use to learn.**"
